Share Share this post Adam Mancini's S&P 500 (SPX/ES Futures) Trade Companion 8 Of The Last 9 days Red For SPX. More Coming? March 5 Plan Copy link Facebook Email Notes More 4 Share This week has been a masterclass for day traders with record volatility (and today was certainly the most volatile day at least since August 2024) and been mostly centered around one level/zone in ES: 5858 and 5875. We began the engagement of this level last Friday, and ES was in an unusual spot heading into last Friday: It had sold off for 6 days in a row, for the first time since April 2024. Remember that after elevator down selloffs, ES always sees a vicious counter-squeeze , and it usually comes on my core setup: The Failed Breakdown.

After 6 red days, heading into last Friday, I wrote on Thursday at 4pm that: “We are 6 red days in a row in ES and probably overdue for a bounce soon. Getting a bounce, and sustaining a bounce are two different matters though. ” On Friday ES saw a violent Failed Breakdown below the 5858 shelf, flushing it by 10 points, recovering, and we rallied 130 points into Monday morning. This 5858 shelf was a major support all day Friday for 5+ touches, and also happened to roughly coincide with support of a multi-year bull market channel. As I warned though, getting a bounce is one thing, sustaining is another.

We hit 6000 Monday morning and began a deep flush, aided by more Tariff headlines. Heading into 7am this morning, what did ES do all night last night? It spent all night basing and bouncing - yet again - off that 5858 support shelf. I wrote yesterday: “Bear case tomorrow: Resumes under 5850.” First thing this morning, we lost this, shorts triggered, and we commenced a violent, 100+ point selloff down into today’s lows.

Deja Vu however. What happens a deep selloff? A short squeeze, and it should be no shock where we bounced too by the close today: 5858 then 5875 yet again. From there, we rejected. This means ES is now 8 of the last 9 days red. Is more incoming or can ES try to mix in another green day?

In today’s newsletter I’ll talk this, I’ll discuss the sequence of events that lead into yesterdays collapse (firstly a monster Failed Breakdown on Friday that rallied us 130 points, then a Breakdown Short yesterday that took us back down). Finally, I’ll discuss the actionable trade plan for tomorrow.

**********Important Housekeeping Notices********

(NEW) Contract Roll: Effective Tuesday December 17th, ES will roll over from December (ESZ2024) front month contract, to March (ESH2025) front month. December will expire Friday December 20th and stop trading completely. Rollover for ES is once per quarter and takes a little over a week to complete (from December 16 to December 20th) as volume gradually transfers between contracts. If using TradingView the ticker remains ES1!, it is /ES on TOS, /ES on E*trade etc. Starting Tuesday December 17th and for the next three month all prices will be March (ESH2024). This means the last day I will be trading the December contract will be Monday December 16th . Note that for those who use TradingView, there is also a handy indicator that converts ES SPY and SPX prices to each other called “SPY SPX ES Price Converter”. Currently, the spread between SPX and ES is 5 points, but after rollover the spread will blow out to around 65 points.

VERY IMPORTANT FOR NEW READERS: It is absolutely essential for all new readers to read my methodology section. It can be found both pinned on the home page of my Substack (tradecompanion.substack.com) and can also be found at the following link: My Trade Methodology I will update this page periodically, and when I do, I will post here. This page provides a broad overview of all the components of my methodology, risk/trade management system, as well as entry setups and trade philosophy. Through time reading the newsletter, these concepts will crystallize in practice and I provide the more fine details in each daily newsletter.

All times listed here are in EST.

If your chart doesn’t match mine, you may need to remove the rollover gap. Usually there is a “back-adjust” setting in most platforms. In tradingview its “b-adj” on the bottom right.

NOTE: I have updated my methodology page. In particular Section 9, point #4 related to Failed Breakdowns and how to time the entry.

The Run Down on The Level To Level Approach: What, Why, How

This section is intended for newer/learning readers and should be understood carefully before progressing. If you are experienced, with the approach, you can skip this. I include this in every newsletter, because understanding it is so fundamental, that profitability over a large sample as a day trader is probably not possible without understanding it. As we saw in today’s action, I frequently talk about how trading is simple, but not easy. It is simple in the sense there are only a few fundamental market principles that are required to be consistantly profitable, and they are not overly hard to understand intellectually (trading is not calculus, as I often say). It is not easy, however, because one needs to implement these principles, which takes high-level and extremely consistent discipline.

The most foundational of all these principles (I would call this a law, not a principle) relates to how intraday moves are distributed. If you don’t understand this, and trade in full accordance with it, it is very hard mathematically speaking to be profitable. Every profitable intraday trader understands this and executes according to it, whether they know it, or not (most do thought). That law is that 90% of intraday moves do not follow through to produce a smooth trend day, or near-trend day. Most days, price is spending the majority of the session playing in various sized ranges, they go a few levels, squeeze the other way, go a few levels squeeze the other way, reverse. 10% of the time then, price will put in explosive, multi-level trend moves. These moves are typically short lived when they do occur, lasting something like 1-3 hours, but can occasionally last all day. This is an average of course (you will find those trendy days tend to cluster together in reality), but even on the days that are in hindsight strong trend days , price will often take the most convoluted, trap-filled, stop-hunting pathway intraday before the 1-3 hr trend move, to ensure most traders aren’t on board. The simple way to summarize this, is that 90% of the time, price “does not move in straight lines”, or “price does not move linearly”. The golden rule of markets is that they always take the most complex, convoluted pathway from point A to B. Price may get to your “target” but it will make sure you aren’t on board.

When you understand this, you unlock profitability and a few things become clear. Firstly, you cannot “predict” intraday action, it will usually take such a random, complex path, that “predictions” will only create biases that hinder flexible reaction to the action. There is nobody on earth who can successful predict intraday price action on a consistent basis (elite traders don’t even try). Secondly, you have to trade level to level. If 90% of price moves don’t follow through for trend days or near trend days (rather, they go a few levels, reverse, go a few levels, reverse, then eventually, explode into a trend or near trend day), it stands to reason that you *have to* lock in gains systematically level to level. This is the exact opposite of what most new traders do, and nearly all brand-new traders are constantly hunting home runs. They think every move is the next “big one”. If you hunt home runs constantly you will find that you overwhelmingly get trapped , and your good entries will very frequently go “green to red” as price runs a few levels then reverses. These “left on the table” gains add up to staggering, transformative wealth over the span of a year. Then, to make matters worse, you will frequently miss those huge trend moves when they do happen. After getting chopped up over and over chasing “home runs” on multiple moves that don’t follow through, the typical new trader will end up in deep drawdown, confused, and frustrated, then the market will often take off without them.

This is why level to level trade management is everything. If you lock in gains systematically level to level, then as long as you have a half decent entry, you will stack gains on all those moves that only go a few levels and reverse.

What about those big trend moves then, or those days that trend non-stop? Again, level to level trade management has the answer: Leave runners. After you lock in 75% profits at first level, do it again at the second level, then leave 10% to go. What then happens? If price goes 7 points and fails you win . If price goes 20 points and fails, you win (your runner will handle it), If price puts in the biggest trend day of the year, you also win, you are on board with those runners.

Do this on every single trade, regardless of what you think, or how you feel, and you can “hack” that fundamental law of how intraday moves are distributed to your favor, rather than be a victim of it. When you do this, you no longer have to guess when to take profits, where, or how much. You stop flipping back and forth frantically. You stop getting trapped over and over. Your stress goes down, and your profits go up. You do it the same way everytime, and that way is in accordance with the mathematics around markets follow through.

To summarize the trade management methodology, it therefore goes like this: Lock in 75% profits at first level up. From there, you can move your stop up, for me, it will usually go several points points under break-even, but I am flexible here. My only core criteria is that I *will not let the entire trade go back red*. I want to give the trade every chance to work as long as it does nothing structurally wrong (loses a major support etc). Apply common sense. From there, lock in more at next level up, leave 10% to go. Trail the 10% via the trailing stop system in the method section. You can adjust these ratios as per your personal sizing constraints.

You won’t make a dollar from any of the above without 100% systematic trade management. You can have the best entries in the world, but if you don’t lock in gains systematically, you will not profit. You will sell far too late (most the time), or far too early. Do not “guess” where moves will end nor assume that any entry will result in a large move, most don’t and good follow through is not the norm, but the exception. Do not let your emotions or opinions tell you when to exit a trade. You don’t know, I don’t know, nobody knows which setup will result in a one level move and fail dramatically, which will go 4 levels then reverse, or which one will see the rally (or sell) of the century. The vast majority of moves only go 1 -3 levels. A smaller subset go 3 or 4, a rare subset go 4+.

After you understand this, you can *then* turn your focus to the entry setups.

Core Structures/Levels To Engage

These are the some big picture structures/levels that are notable from highest to lowest. These are not comprehensive and are some simply select major structures to take note of, nor are they predictive. I will be trading the plan below, level to level, one move at a time. For levels where I can’t describe them in a few sentences or aren’t obvious, I will simply write “Key Zone”.

6116: This was a major horizontal support shelf from Friday February 14th to Friday February 21st. We broke this down on February 21st and began a massive, multi-day flush that ultimately lasted until today.

6104: We broke this down Friday February 21st and sold 70 points.

6064: A key zone from February 11th to 13th. We set a major high of day here on Monday February 24th.

6026: Support of the purple rising channel structure.

5994-98: Support of the upper white channel structure. It was support all day Monday February 24th and we broke it down on Tuesday February 25th flushing to 5924. It then served as a stubborn resistance zone last Wednesday February 26th most of the day. We back-tested it early Monday morning.

5950: A key level. Rising trendline connecting the Feb 25th and Feb 27th higher lows. We broke this down last Thursday February 27th and flushed to 5860s. It was ultimately the failure of this same line yesterday that triggered the deep flush down to 5820s.

5924-28: This was a stubborn support shelf from Jan 8th to Jan 10th. We set a daily low here on Tuesday February 25th

5907-10: A key level

5893: A horizontal line starting back at September 26th to 30th 2024 where it was a resistance shelf. We set major lows here on October 10th 2024.

5875: This was a big horizontal support zone. We set major 150+ point lows around here on October 23rd, December 20th, January 2nd. Also ultimate support of the orange macro channel structure. This connects the October 2023 and August 2024 higher lows, and controls the most recent leg up of this bull market.

5858: This was a major support shelf all night last night, we broke it down this morning, melted down over 100 points, then back-tested it late day.

5822: This was the low of day yesterday, and was also a critical support early this morning.

5798: Shown in white below, this was also massive horizontal level stretching from the back half of August, through the October lows, into the November 4th pre-election lows.

5757: We set major lows here on Sept 17th and 18th.

5728: Support of the red megaphone pattern in the below chart that contains all price action since November 12th.

5720: A long-term horizontal line, this connects the June 20th and June 28th 2024 major highs and extends rightward.

5695-5700: Round number support.

5676: Back-test of the yellow channel structure we broke out way back on election day.

5645-40: A major horizontal support shelf from June 24th to July 2nd 2024 and extending rightward.

5598-5602: Round number support

5568: This was a huge support shelf. We set major lows here on July 25th and July 30th.

Trade Recap/Education

NOTE: The purpose of this trade recap section is to run down in greater detail previous examples of my three setup types that occurred within the last couple days. These setups are always provided to readers in advance, and the goal of this section is to expedite the lengthy screen time requirement that is associated with learning any trade setup. Trading is no different than learning a sport, or a musical instrument, or any other skill. You need to put in the reps - thousands of them. Unfortunately with trading, these reps are expensive. By showing examples of my three setups here everyday, the hope is readers can develop the pattern recognition quicker. The idea is that if there was a trade you were curious about or wanted more color on that occurred in the last couple days, you can scan through this section and hopefully I have identified it. Scroll to the next section for today’s action and the trade plan for tomorrow.

Before getting into today’s action I just want to discuss the monster Failed Breakdown we had on Friday in a little more detail as we squeezed over 130 points in the final 2hrs of trading Friday into Monday’s 6000 high, followed by the total 100% failure of this squeeze we had yesterday that ultimately culminated in yesterdays and today’s monster collapse to new lows. Remember that while most major squeezes (even in a downtrend context) are caused by Failed Breakdowns, the failure of a failed breakdown to sustain a rally, is very bearish.

Specifically, I am referring to how ES - at 1:15PM on Friday - sold to 5850, trapped shorts, then slingshot higher to 6000 Monday highs. This to me was the quintessential Failed Breakdown as is perhaps the most structural perfect Failed Breakdown in many months in relation to the 3 criteria I use to qualify Failed Breakdowns. I already discussed this in detail in my last newsletter, but I want to add a little more detail here. From there, ES then retraced this entire rally yesterday (with some help from Tariff related “tape bombs”) and we got a great example of my third setup type on Monday after: The Breakdown Short, which took us from 5938-42 yesterday ultimately down 200 points.

I’ll discuss both today.

Why Was The Friday 1:15 Failed Breakdown of 5860 So Special?

The entire sequence began on Friday where ES saw a major 130 point squeeze. This was a last ditched attempt by bulls to rally. Let’s break it down in relation to my three criteria. Firstly, I provided this setup to readers in multiple instances. Firstly, heading into Friday, I was looking for a squeeze, writing on Thursday at 4pm that “We are 6 red days in a row in ES and probably overdue for a bounce soon. Getting a bounce, and sustaining a bounce are two different matters though. My general lean is as long as ES can hold 5875, 5865 lowest, ES can try a pop up the levels to 5914-18, then 5938-42. 5938-42 needs to recover to produce a sustainable squeeze.” By Fridays close we had tagged 5938, dipped, then ripped through.

I also wrote on Thursday at 4pm: “Below [5865] is 5850. Once again I am not overly interested in knife catching in this context but I will be watching the reaction here and if we are selling into it in a more organized, slow manner, and price sees a good reaction there, I’d consider taking this.”

On Friday at 1:15Pm, we hit 5850 which set the low of day. While one could have just bid this and worked out fine, there was a far more attractive and safe entry at play: A Failed Breakdown. Here is why:

1) The quality of a Failed Breakdown is directly related to the quality or significant of the low(s) that are being broken down and recovered. The more significant and high quality the lows, the higher the win rate of the Failed Breakdown, and the farther they will run, on average. The gold standard for a significant low is the prior days low. Ideally price sets a big daily low, rallies, later on flushes it, recovers. If this is not present though, then a good multi-hour low can work. If this not present, then a cluster or shelf of multiple lows can work. In reality, there will be fusions of all the above. On Friday, we had a fusion of all the above at the 5860 level.

We had 1) The Thursday daily low which was ~5860, from which we rallied to 5900 before the open Friday. This level technically tested 2x on Thursday, making it a cluster. 2) At 9:30AM on Tuesday, ES then tested ~5860 again, rallying to 5914. This means we had a daily low, and a multi-hour low. 3) At 12:45PM on Friday, ES tested 5860 again and rallied 20 points. This is as significant as a low can get.

2) There is a bonus applied to Failed Breakdowns if they occur at a major support zone. I’ve discussed at length, but that 5860 zone on Friday was support of the macro uptrend channel (shown in orange in the above chart) which basically controls the whole bull market. It connects the October 2023 and November 2024 higher lows and the 5860 shelf intersected it.

3) The lows then need to flush and recover. This is where the magic comes in for a Failed Breakdown. Rememeber they operate on a rubber band effect. You can imagine the band being “pulled back” below the lows, then released when price recovers the lows. Therefore, the “pull back” is critical. The ideal I give for distance of pullback is 2-11 points. Of course, some are smaller, many are larger, and this is fine. The most important thing is just that the lows recover with force, momentum, and conviction. Here, we lost the 5860 lows by 10 points, right in that sweet spot.

4) We then enter when the lows recover. Please read my methodology page section 9 for details on this, but generally we enter a few points above the lows being recovered, after a time buffer. The time buffer grows as momentum and volatility decline. We want to wait a couple minutes always though. Then, if price is showing fast momentum and volatility is good, we can hop in. If price is sluggish though, volatility is slow, we should wait patiently for price to accept the lows, then get in when some momentum returns. There is an art to this part, but Friday’s Failed Breakdown was quite straightforward as it was fast and smooth.

From here, where went parabolic, putting in a vicious 120 point short squeeze that ultimately took us to 5938 target by Friday’s close, then further to 5980 by Sunday evening. Note I also provided this setup on Twitter on Friday afternoon stating (when were 5850) that 5860 had to recover to initiate the squeeze:

In the tweet I indicated this was an excellent example of how powerful Failed Breakdowns are, and it certainly was taking us to 6000 by yesterday morning.

The Sunday 730PM Back-Test Long Of 5950

After squeezing to 5980s off Sundays open, ES saw a fairly complex example of my secondary setup type: The Back-Test Long. This is a little advanced, but recall that heading into Sunday, there were two supports worth watching: 5938-40 and 5950. I wrote Friday at 4pm: “For Monday, the first substantial support down is 5938-40. I’m quite hesitant to be buying a support this close to the daily high (it would be only be a small retrace of this weeks rally). However, we are dipping into it in an organized, controlled manner and we seem to be reacting there, I’d take it. If we are melting down on the latest tariff headline though, wait for it to test then recover 5950 .” (note that when I wrote this on Friday at 4pm, we were essentially sitting right at 5950 so I could not emphasize it as much since we were sitting right there, from my perspective of writing Friday, 5938-42 was first down, but since we rallied to 5980s off the Sunday open, 5950 became more relevant.

At 730PM Sunday we sold to ~5950 (5947) and then squeezed to 6000. Why is this a setup? Its a back-test long. Remember a Back-Test long occurs whenever ES Breaks a major, well-tested, previously defended resistance shelf/trendline, and then re-tests it from above. Then, typically on the first back-test, it is actionable. Of course some back-test levels hold dozens of times, but for our purposes the 1st test is highest probability. Levels on average do weaken with successive tests, so after that we want to be more patient and wait for a Failed Breakdown or some other evidence that the level is showing signs of life before we engage.

In this case the Breakout occurred in the final half hour of trading on Friday when we went parabolic from 5930s to into the close. There were two levels in question here which we broke out. Firstly was 5938-42. I wrote Thursday at 4pm that: “5938-42 needs to recover to produce a sustainable squeeze.” 5938-42 was the trendline connecting the February 25th and February 27th higher lows. We broke this line down on Thursday afternoon and flushed to 5860.

In addition, we also had the 5950 level. 5950 was a major support dating back to January 27th. We set a major low there January 27th, February 3rd, and February 26th. On Friday afternoon, the recovery of this huge cluster at 5938-40 and 5950 took us parabolic into Sunday. Therefore, we could engage the 1st back-test of this zone to take a long. We rallied to 5980s, sold down to 5947 or so, then popped to 6000+ by Monday morning.

Note that in terms of how to enter here, we can simply watch the price action then react. We never need to guess what price will do. Does it sell to 5938-40 then recover 5950? We can take that long. Dip to 5947 then recover 5950 as it did in this case? We can take that. If you are unsure of a level, you can just wait and see how price reacts. You never to rush into anything, you can wait for the zone to react and show strength (flush and recover), then get in.

Note this setup was a little more complex than the typical Back-Test long, which looks like this:

Here, what we had was a support shelf last week at 5950, 5938-40. It then broke down on Thursday, sold to 5860, then recovered on Friday afternoon. Remember that a Back-Test long simply means we trade the back-test of a zone that broke out, so it does not matter if the zone was a resistance, or a former support-turned-resistance that recovered. As long as its recovery squeezed us, we can trade it. This took us to 6000 by Monday morning

The Monday 12:45Pm Breakdown Short

I wrote on Friday at 4pm: “There is a more advanced short available below 5938-40 as well. As always I’d need to see a bounce here, then one could short below the lows of that bounce. Likely lower 5930s.”

We saw a very textbook Breakdown Short here at around 12:45PM yesterday. Remember that Breakdown Shorts (which I’ve written on extensively lately) occur when price loses a significant, well-tested, previously defended support shelf. This is the most important criteria, there has to be something to clearly breakdown, otherwise you are just shorting air. We certainly had this at 5938-42, and it was an important zone as discussed above.

However, we cannot just rush in short below a zone, because 80%+ of Breakdowns are traps (Failed Breakdowns). If you dive in headfirst short, you’ll get trapped. Therefore, to fix this, the Breakdown Short requires that after you identify a zone you want to short below, you need to see a bounce and/or Failed Breakdown at the zone immediately before you short. By immediately, ideally within 12hrs. This final bounce(s) serves to use up any remaining demand at the zone, get the traps out of the system.

After those bounce(s) fail, we can short below all the noise. We saw this Monday at 5938. We tested it 3x between 10am and 12:30PM. After this, one could short below all the noise in low 5930s.

We lost this, and went “elevator down” flushing to 5820s by Mondays close. This was assisted by another Tariff related ‘Tape Bomb’.

The Monday 3:45PM 5858 Failed Breakdown

This tape bomb took us down to major new lows at 5821 by 3:30PM yesterday.I tweeted shortly after that “no rally until 5858 recovers in ES” and we got this at 3:45PM. This popped us 15+ points into the close. This one should take little explaining. Why? Its the exact same Failed Breakdown we had on Friday. That 5858 level was the shelf of lows we set all day Friday. Just below there was the 5850 Friday low. By recovering 5858 and 5850, we recovered both, and is actionable.

All the above content focuses on entries. We must not forget, however, the most important part: Trade management, or what you do after entry. You must always take profits level to level. If you are not taking profits level to level as a day trader, there is literally no way to succeed. After you press “buy” or “sell”, turn your mind off, and turn autopilot on. No thinking, no opinion. Run the level to level algorithm. Never try to predict how far any move will go, or its path. You don’t know if it will go 1 level and fail, 2 levels and fail, or run for days. The only sure thing is that over a large sample, no human being can consistently choose targets accurately enough to be profitable. Therefore, be systematic, lock in level to level, let a runner work. This way, you “win” no matter what price does. Goes one level and fails? You win. Goes 100+ points? You are in a runner. It does not matter what you think price will do , you must still always lock in 75% profits at the first level, leave a 25% runner, then lock in more at second level up, and let a 10% runner go and initiate the trailing stop methodology. No opinions, no emotions, no thoughts - manage trades systematically, the same way every time. 90% of moves do not follow through, if you do not lock in gains level to level, you will *not* succeed as a day trader.

Screenshot taken before the close yesterday

On to today: Daily Summary/Trade Recap

Monday Evening: Heading into today I was holding a 25% long runner off the 5858 Failed Breakdown discussed above, writing at the close yesterday: “I took the 5857 Failed Breakdown which I tweeted out at 3:29PM (shown above). I managed this as always and locked in 75% profits at 5865, left 25% to run.”

This tagged 5875 next level up shortly after and I locked in more profits as always, left 10% to run. Heading into today, the general big picture theme was explained yesterday, as follows:

By now, most are acquinted with the infamous Trump “Tariff Tape Bombs” as we’ve seen many this year, but this afternoons was one of the larger ones. As always we can’t predict when these will occur, or even what direction (because there are also squeezes). We can only plan our spots and then react. Quite frequently, these tape bombs do see a Failed Breakdown shortly after which is what we saw late day today which is usually actionable for a level to level, but whether it sustains or not is dependant on how able ES is to recover some of the major support shelves that failed during the collapse. There is a laundry list of them above here - the most important of which is 5943 which is where we collapsed from after 1pm today - and bulls have their work cut out for them. As always, we just need to take things level to level, one setup at a time and it is even more important when volatility is elevated. If you try to “predict” what price will do in these volatile markets, you are sabotaging yourself before you even start. You have to put the crystal ball away. Stop asking if a top is in, if a bottom is in, where ES is going in three days, and just trade.

Remember the concept of control is important. While ES can see bounces and many of theme substantial (usually on Failed Breakdowns) this does not bulls have taken control. Control requires ES to recover - typically multiple - major supports that failed during the selloff. In other words, its a process, not an even, and each major recovery wrestles a little control from bears back to bulls. While who controls does necessarily affect our execution at all, it is good to have an idea nonetheless as we know that if bears control we need to be much more cautious with longs.

With this in mind, we can sit back and wait for new setups.

I wrote yesterday: “In terms of spots to add on strength, its tricky here as we saw a late day squeeze of ~50 points. If ES can accept 5875 though, the recovery of this zone may be actionable at or a little above. Be sure to take profits level to level here at 5884 first up.” We spent last evening bumping into 5875 from below then popping to 5784 *exact to the tick* overnight.

Since I was already in my 10% runner long I did not take this.

Tuesday Morning 7am to 830AM:

When I woke up and checked price this morning, ES was literally exactly in the process of triggering a classic Breakdown Short. I wrote yesterday: “Bear case tomorrow: Resumes under 5850….. Perhaps a test of 5850 that tries to recover 5858, or even a big bounce at 5858 would work. After this bounce is set, one can short below the lows wherever they are. Perhaps 5842 but it could be higher.”

Remember that as discussed above, a Breakdown Short occurs when ES builds out a clearly defined, obvious shelf. Then we want to see a final bounce and/or Failed Breakdown at that shelf immediately before we short (by immediately I mean within the last 12hrs). We saw exactly this. Overnight from 11pm to 3am ES built a shelf at 5857.

From 5am to 7am, ES then built another shelf at 5850 as per the above setup. Here we had two shelves: One at 5857, and one at 5850. Seeing the struggles to bounce at 5850 for 2hrs, I was good shorting here at 7am at around 5845 below the overnight lows. I cut out of my 10% long runner at the same time.

This short followed through nicely and I managed as always: Locked in 75% profits at 5832 1st down, left 25% to run. I locked in more at 5821 second down, left 10% to go.

With a green trade in the books, this means its time for profit protection mode and time to let runners work and do absolutely nothing . As I often say I (and every other professional trader), don’t trade because the market is moving, because we are bored, because we have FOMO. We trade because a planned setup triggers at a planned zone, then the rest of the time is sitting there.

What does profit protection mode mean? This means after a win 1) I have to sit on the runner and do nothing all day, no other trades allowed. 2) I can take a second or third trade, only IF the runner stops out below break-even (or via a trailer if it is a larger rally where a trailing stop is involved), AND a new, pre-planned setup emerges. 3) I can take this second or third trade only risking the profits from the first, to ensure I have a green day. I take not going green to red on the day very seriously as do I take profit preservation very seriously.

Tuesday 830AM: Around 830AM, we got a small Failed Breakdown. I wrote yesterday: “I am in no rush to long below there, but possible ideas could be a failed breakdown of today’s low, bonus if it tags 5814 first. Below there, we test 5798 ”. We flushed yesterdays 5821 low, dipped several points, then recovered. This worked for those who took it but I opted to just hold my short runner

By 9:45AM, we tagged 5798, bounced 20 points, then continued the melt down into 5740. Moves like this are exactly why I hold runners. W hen I got short sub 5850, did I know we were going to flush 80 points? While I certainly thought it possible given we had just broken down a macro bull market channel from 2023, we could have also easily just sold down a level or two then squeezed for the day. I just don’t know, and neither do you, or anyone else. We simply run the process: Lock in gains level to level, let a runner work. This way you win either way, without needing to know what price will do. Your objective is to systematize your decision making, that way you don’t need to be a psychic and know precisely how far any move will go.

Readers also know that in ES I treat short runners differently than I treat longs - something I’ve written on extensively. Namely, I am much quicker to cut out of my short runners. Why? This is review, but longs and shorts aren’t the same in ES. In ES, shorts go “elevator down”. They are violent, fast, but typically short-lived. Then, they result in the infamous short squeeze, typically on a Failed Breakdown. Even in true bear markets, ES spent a relatively small amount of time actually selling. Those sells are just packed into very small windows, and cover lots of ground fast (think 50-200 points on average). The rest of the time ES is violently short squeezing, or consolidating it wide ranges. For this reason, I keep shorts runners on a tighter leash than longs and am more discretionary in how I manage them. Typically, I’ll exit them if ES recovers a major shelf or puts in a high momentum failed breakdown. They aren’t like longs where ES can drift or grind higher for days on end on low volatility. Remember, SPX spends 70-75% of the time going up over its history.

After hitting 5740 we squeezed back to 5798 and I decided to cut out of my runner here around 1pm. As I tweeted at 12:56PM reclaim of 5798 would see a pop to 5821, and this is what we saw.

While I could have flipped long here, I was happy with my sizable gain from the morning and fine sidelined here. We rallied to 5858 back-test after this by 3pm.

Trading does not need to be more active than what I did today, despite the volatility. I try to emphasize this daily, you don’t need to be pressing buttons all day and going long and short. No serious trader is doing this. The market will serve you up A+ trades on a platter once or twice a day, and trades that have a miniscule chance of failing. But the catch, is you need to just wait for them, then protect the gains afterwards. Most people either can’t wait for them, or can’t protect the gains after. As a result, they join the 95% of day traders who don’t profit. As I frequently say, there is no such thing as hard trading conditions, you are in total control of that by how often you trade. If your trying to force in 10 trades in ultra complex, choppy action, its going to be hard. If your a hunter though who can patiently wait for your shot (a clear Failed Breakown or Breakdown Short), take it level to level, then get out of the way and sit on a runner before you get ran over.

As always the only reason I share these trade recap sections is because when I started off trading - I had many very costly assumptions about what profitable trading looked like - and it took years to dispel these. I did not have a chance to speak to any legitimate professional traders until a few years into my learning curve, and as such, had nobody to correct me. The most costly assumption I had was this idea that profitable trading is active. I assumed that profitable day traders were sitting down at 8am or 930am, and then buying and selling all day, flipping back and forth long and short, racking up trade after trade. I was totally shocked when I met a mentor of mine early on (who is/was a very successful 8 figure futures fund manager) and he told me he waited 48 hours for what turned into a 9 point scalp. Not a single trade in that time period. Not only this, but as I got in touch with more and more professionals, I found they all shared this trait. On most days, I had done more trades by 11pm or noon than these people do in a full week. I was losing, they weren’t. They know that less trading is more and as Jesse Livermore famously said, the money is made in the sitting (In our case either in runners after a trade, or on the sidelines waiting for one). Simplify your trading.

Over the years I dropped my trades per day from 7,8+ starting off, to 1-2 now, and my profitability directly increased with every decline in trades per day. This is because trading is because picking your spots and if you have an edge, chances are good the vast majority of price action on any given day won’t correspond to it. If you are forcing trades just because the market is moving, there is a good chance that you are taking trades with no edge (driven by FOMO, impulse, revenge trading, boredom etc), and those trades will lose on a net basis. You are better off doing 1 or 2 trades a day and having them win (and leaving runners in case of extended trend exposure) than doing 5 trades and having the first two being big wins then losing it all on further trades and missing a sustained trend that you would have captured had you just stayed in runners. It is true that on very volatile days though there may be more than 1-2 great setups, but even on those days, I still don’t put profits back at risk and will typically just sit in runners. Runners have the incredible effect of reducing FOMO, providing exposure to sustained trend, reducing trades per day and generally help solve the issues discussed above.

I do the same template daily: I do 1-2 trades daily. These trades are typically before 11am, or after 3pm. I often enter between 730am and 830am, but this is not a hard rule. If there is no good entry in that morning window, I will enter later. I enter only at pre-planned, high conviction zones, on A+ setups. I rarely trade the window between 11am and 2pm as its often chop. First trade is a win in the morning, I hold the runner and I stop trading, only rarely trying one more in the afternoon. First trade is a loss, I trade one more. Both trades are losses, I quit for the day.

Trade Plan Wednesday

Supports are: 5798 (major), 5790, 5784 (major), 5777, 5767, 5763, 5757 (major), 5750, 5740, 5730 (major), 5724, 5720 (major), 5714, 5707, 5698 (major), 5689, 5676 (major), 5668 (major), 5660, 5642-46 (major), 5631, 5627 (major), 5616, 5608, 5598-5602 (major), 5592, 5584, 5580 (major), 5572, 5567 (major), 5563, 5558, 5548 (major), 5533, 5529, 5514-18 (major).

In terms of lvls I’d bid direct: As tweeted all afternoon, 5858 then 5875 were huge resistances. Not only did they back-test where we broke down from this morning, but were also targets for this afternoons monster squeeze. Having “missed” the squeeze up this afternoon, I decided to grab the back-test short after we tagged 5875 then lost 5858 as per the above tweet. This was managed level to level down to a 10% runner and I’ll cut this and take long when one triggers. This was a very odd day for me because its probably the first day (perhaps since starting the newsletter in 2021) that both my trades were shorts. Today was also a great example of the “elevator down” into “short squeeze” cycle that I have devoted so many thousands of words to writing about in the past few years. If we are entering into a sustained downtrend or bear market, you need to get used to this cycle, because we will see it most days. Readers can also see this week why its so important not to try and “predict” the price action because price will always take the most complex, and trap-filled path between point A and B. In other words - price does not move in straight lines for long and only about 10% of days are true trend days where price sticks to one direction all day. Case in point: Think of the action since Friday where we rallied from 5860 to 5900, sold to 5850 on Friday, squeezed to 6000 by yesterday morning, flushed yesterday to 5821, rallied to 5884 last night, melted down to 5798, popped 20 points, sold again to 5740, then squeeed to 5858 by 3pm today then 5875 by 3:30PM before flushing back to 5760s. There is no human on earth who can predict this, and elite traders don’t even bother. They just plan their setups, and react when triggered, manage systematically, then repeat. Tomorrow will require more flexibility and I would recommend sizing down. This is hard to write today as we are whipping around at 20-30 points per second but the broad theme though is bears remain in control and until bulls can recover 5875, this is the case. As of writing 5798 is first down. This has been a major magnet today . Given how volatile ES is though and given that bears are in control, I am not interested in directly buying any supports anymore and will only engage failed breakdowns if I get long. Recoveries of 5798 are of interest though, especially if we can do so with speed and momentum. An alternate entry tomorrow for longs would be if we can flush down to 5763 or 5757, lose this afternoons 5768 low, then recover. Below there, we likely free fall down to new lows again and there is little of interest until 5730. Again I am not knife catching any longs in this market, but if we can flush it down to perhaps 5720 and recover, this would be more interesting. Another option would be if we put in a massive Failed Breakdown of todays 5740ish low. Below there, 5698 and 5676 are zones of interest.

Resistances are: 5814, 5822 (major), 5832, 5836, 5842, 5850, 5858 (major), 5866, 5875 (major), 5883, 5889 (major), 5893, 5902, 5907-10 (major), 5918, 5924-28 (major), 5934, 5943 (major), 5950 (major), 957, 5964, 5968 (major), 5977, 5983, 5988, 5996 (major), 6004, 6008, 6014, 6020, 6024-28 (major). If we squeeze back up the levels tomorrow, there are few back-test of interest, but unfortunately the quality ones were already used up today. 5858 though may have another dip left in it and 5875 may as well but both have been tested already. If 5875 clears, we could see a monster squeeze.

Bull case tomorrow: Bears control and this is true until 5875 reclaims, at which point would have done something to balance the market a little better. The bull case tomorrow would simply be that ES can take another crack 5858 then 5875. To do so bulls will ideally want to hold this afternoons low or 5757 lowest (or we will need another major low first). From there, the recovery of 5798 can start us up. Another possible entry would be the recovery of 5822. Again with this ideally is not to rush. Wait for price to test the zone, react, accept it, then get in when its clearing with momentum.

Bear case tomorrow: Bears can try a new low below 5757. As I say everyday, there is a strong disclaimer that goes with these types of trades. These types of level loss shorts below a support are called breakdown trades. My core edge is failed breakdowns, and the reason is this is an edge is the vast majority of break downs (80%) trap. They take great skill to execute, and even when done well by a trader who has mastered these setups, one should expect over 60% to fail (they are low win rate, high R/R trades. 2 or 3 in a row will fail, then the 4th will pay out huge). *If you don’t like these odds and cant tolerate being trapped - simply don’t take them. I consider breakdown trades to be an advanced setup type so if a newer subscriber, there is nothing wrong with passing on these. Ideally with 5757, I’d like to see a final bounce either there, or around there. Just look for a shelf or cluster of lows to form somewhere. Afterwards, one can short below as per Breakdown Short criteria. 5754 possible entry.

In summary for tomorrow: In these 10/10 volatile markets, I prefer not to have any lean and just flow with the price. If I have to give one though, its that ES can try another crack at 5858 then 5875. Those will need to clear though, or we just resume lower to 5730, and beyond. Triggers are included above.

As always no crystal balls, no guessing, no predicting. I’ll be trading the above plan following whatever path price chooses. Reacting level to level, one move at a time, take profits, reset bias from scratch. Not choosing the path for price ahead of time, and hoping it agrees with me. *You don’t need an opinion on where price is going to make money*.

Important disclaimer on my trading philosophy: I am a day trader - this means I am not a “bull” nor am I a “bear”. I have zero preference on where ES is going to be in a month, a week, tomorrow, in 12hrs, or even in the next hour. What I do care about is catching the next immediate move, from one level to the next, taking profits & growing my account, then resetting my view from scratch. I do, however, post a general lean/estimated guess here each day on what my bias is for price path going forward. While it is good to have a general hypothesis on what path price will follow, this always needs to come very secondary to the real-time execution of the trade plan. The algos and professional traders you are competing against all day are not doing crystal ball predictions about where price i5s going. They do not know, nor do they care - they are *reacting* to actionable signals, and managing the subsequent trade with a rigid risk and trade management process. This is the o5nly way to make real money as a day trader. This means whether tomorrow is a big red breakdown, a non-event day, or an upward squeeze, I will be reacting and trading the price action level to level, one move at a time, then resetting bias and moving on to the next trade. Let the price path unfold as it chooses - React to the price action, don’t predict it. “Forecasters” and “Traders” are totally different professions.

• (NEW) Contract Roll: Effective Tuesday December 17th, ES will roll over from December (ESZ2024) front month contract, to March (ESH2025) front month. December will expire Friday December 20th and stop trading completely. Rollover for ES is once per quarter and takes a little over a week to complete (from December 16 to December 20th) as volume gradually transfers between contracts. If using TradingView the ticker remains ES1!, it is /ES on TOS, /ES on E*trade etc. Starting Tuesday December 17th and for the next three month all prices will be March (ESH2024). This means the last day I will be trading the December contract will be Monday December 16th . Note that for those who use TradingView, there is also a handy indicator that converts ES SPY and SPX prices to each other called “SPY SPX ES Price Converter”. Currently, the spread between SPX and ES is 5 points, but after rollover the spread will blow out to around 65 points.

• VERY IMPORTANT FOR NEW READERS: It is absolutely essential for all new readers to read my methodology section. It can be found both pinned on the home page of my Substack (tradecompanion.substack.com) and can also be found at the following link: My Trade Methodology I will update this page periodically, and when I do, I will post here. This page provides a broad overview of all the components of my methodology, risk/trade management system, as well as entry setups and trade philosophy. Through time reading the newsletter, these concepts will crystallize in practice and I provide the more fine details in each daily newsletter.

• All times listed here are in EST.

• If your chart doesn’t match mine, you may need to remove the rollover gap. Usually there is a “back-adjust” setting in most platforms. In tradingview its “b-adj” on the bottom right.

• NOTE: I have updated my methodology page. In particular Section 9, point #4 related to Failed Breakdowns and how to time the entry.

• 6116: This was a major horizontal support shelf from Friday February 14th to Friday February 21st. We broke this down on February 21st and began a massive, multi-day flush that ultimately lasted until today.

• 6104: We broke this down Friday February 21st and sold 70 points.

• 6064: A key zone from February 11th to 13th. We set a major high of day here on Monday February 24th.

• 6026: Support of the purple rising channel structure.

• 5994-98: Support of the upper white channel structure. It was support all day Monday February 24th and we broke it down on Tuesday February 25th flushing to 5924. It then served as a stubborn resistance zone last Wednesday February 26th most of the day. We back-tested it early Monday morning.

• 5950: A key level. Rising trendline connecting the Feb 25th and Feb 27th higher lows. We broke this down last Thursday February 27th and flushed to 5860s. It was ultimately the failure of this same line yesterday that triggered the deep flush down to 5820s.

• 5924-28: This was a stubborn support shelf from Jan 8th to Jan 10th. We set a daily low here on Tuesday February 25th

• 5907-10: A key level

• 5893: A horizontal line starting back at September 26th to 30th 2024 where it was a resistance shelf. We set major lows here on October 10th 2024.

• 5875: This was a big horizontal support zone. We set major 150+ point lows around here on October 23rd, December 20th, January 2nd. Also ultimate support of the orange macro channel structure. This connects the October 2023 and August 2024 higher lows, and controls the most recent leg up of this bull market.

• 5858: This was a major support shelf all night last night, we broke it down this morning, melted down over 100 points, then back-tested it late day.

• 5822: This was the low of day yesterday, and was also a critical support early this morning.

• 5798: Shown in white below, this was also massive horizontal level stretching from the back half of August, through the October lows, into the November 4th pre-election lows.

• 5757: We set major lows here on Sept 17th and 18th.

• 5728: Support of the red megaphone pattern in the below chart that contains all price action since November 12th.

• 5720: A long-term horizontal line, this connects the June 20th and June 28th 2024 major highs and extends rightward.

• 5695-5700: Round number support.

• 5676: Back-test of the yellow channel structure we broke out way back on election day.

• 5645-40: A major horizontal support shelf from June 24th to July 2nd 2024 and extending rightward.

• 5598-5602: Round number support

• 5568: This was a huge support shelf. We set major lows here on July 25th and July 30th.

• Supports are: 5798 (major), 5790, 5784 (major), 5777, 5767, 5763, 5757 (major), 5750, 5740, 5730 (major), 5724, 5720 (major), 5714, 5707, 5698 (major), 5689, 5676 (major), 5668 (major), 5660, 5642-46 (major), 5631, 5627 (major), 5616, 5608, 5598-5602 (major), 5592, 5584, 5580 (major), 5572, 5567 (major), 5563, 5558, 5548 (major), 5533, 5529, 5514-18 (major).
